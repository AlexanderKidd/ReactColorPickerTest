# ReactColorPickerTest
Color Picker in React for a code interview.

## Set Up

I wanted to avoid making a CRA to show I knew the basic structure of a React app, and I don't believe CRA has LTS React anyway (*requirement*). Here is how I set up the project:

1. Node project initialization

2. Install Babel and Webpack and configure respective config files in root

3. Install webpack HTML index file handler

4. Install React and React DOM

5. Create public/index.html and src/App.js and index.js as starting points

6. Add scripts to run webpack dev server
